# WEB103 Prework - Creatorverse 

Submitted by: Shivesh Gupta

**About this web app:** A full-stack React application for discovering and managing content creators. Users can browse creator profiles with images and descriptions, view detailed creator information, and perform CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) on creator entries. The app uses async/await patterns with Axios or fetch() for API integration and features a card-based UI design.

Time spent: 6 hours

## Notes

While building the app, the hardest part was making sure everything was styled correctly and completing the database actions so that I can exercise the CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete). Once those were set, the rest was easy to implement.
